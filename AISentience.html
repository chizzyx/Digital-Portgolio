    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">AI seems to be improving by the minute doing things we never thought were capable of non humans. This may look impressive at first glance but only if youre ignoring all the ramifications. Sentient AI may be beneficial but it could hurt us more than it helps us.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">Last year, Deep Minds AlphaFold AI system, descended from the Go playing one,  was able to predict three-dimensional structures of proteins from their one dimensional amino acid sequences. It solved the protein folding problem. And made predictions for nearly all 200 million proteins know to exist. This is an incredible feat no human could have accomplished and will allow medical researchers to develop new drugs and vaccines for years to come. AI when being used for things humans cant accomplish presents no problems. But recently, large language models are being used to write screenplays, compose marketing emails, develop videogames, write book reviews and more. AI are even becoming eerily good at having humanlike text conversations. Its becoming better at language and reasoning then humans are. This is scary because AI could end up putting a lot of people out of jobs. AI is only getting more incredible and improving faster and faster. If AI bests humans at everything what are humans left to do?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">AI has made incredible advances already and can do many things humans cant. But in a way that could hurt humanity. Once AI becomes advanced enough to put us all out of a job what happens. Its only a matter of time.</p>
