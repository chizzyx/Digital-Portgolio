In that class we learned to code in swift. We learned to create different types of graphics to help us with our isp. We also learned about Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal, and Binary systems to help us code. We worked on multiple missions to help us practice our coding in swift that taught us multiple different skills leading to our ISP. Our independent service project was a game my group and I designed using the skills we learned coding merlin missions. Our ISP game was called Spacehopper and was inspired by jetpack joyride.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 300px; text-indent: 40px; line-height: 2">We wanted to make a obstacle dodging game. The point of the game would be to get as far as possible without hitting an obstacle otherwise the game would be over. We took concepts from parkour styled games like Vector run and simple jump mechanic games like Dinosaur run. We also wanted there to be background music when you're playing like there is in games like Minion Run  and Subway Surfers. That way the game wouldnt feel slow or boring as you're playing.</p>
      <p style="font-size:18px; text-indent: 40px; line-height: 2">We were motivated by many sources. Our background was inspired by the game Omori. We liked the 8-bit stye that the game featured and the color theme of the game. The gameplay itself is mainly influenced by the browser game Dinosaur run. Like the game Dinosaur run, you are speeding towards obstacles and are forced to dodge them to continue playing or the game will end. Our music is from the game Mario Kart. We didn't want the game to feel slow paced and the soundtrack from Mario Kart felt perfect.</p>
      <p style="font-size:18px; margin-right: 300px; text-indent: 40px; line-height: 2">One of the most difficult things to do for our project was make the object jump. There was also a problem with getting the right amount of time for the jump because the hang time would be too long or too short. When we first started developing our project, we did not have the images we were going to use as the characters or background yet because we wanted to be original and make it ourselves instead of using an image from google.</p>
