    <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px;">This is the main page to my Computer Science Portfolio. This portfolio is incredibly important to me because it will follow me throughout my life. I can use it to show of my work and it'll be useful in the future if I apply for a job related to programming. This portfolio could serve as a resume or proof of my accomplishments. This Digital Portfolio is also important to me because it serves as experience. I'm learning to code in html which will be useful in the future when building other websites. Overall this Digial Portdolio is vital because it is teaching me to code in html and this Digital Portfolio lets people know about my skill set and experience programming. By keeping up with my digital portfolio throughout my programming career will allow me to show off previous projects when applying for a job, trying to get into college or a promotion in the programming field.  </p>
